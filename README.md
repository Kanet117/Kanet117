# 👋 Hey, I'm Kanet Sahid Ochoa Guzman

🚀 AI Agent Builder | Python Dev | Co-founder @ Chaptter | IBM Collaborator

I'm passionate about creating intelligent solutions that solve real-world problems. I specialize in AI agents, automation, and smart systems that *actually work* in production environments. My focus is on speed, precision, and meaningful impact.

## 🧠 What I Do Best

- 🤖 **Conversational AI & Agentic Systems**  
  Build AI agents using OpenAI (Agents SDK, ChatGPT) and Watson to automate workflows and execute tasks with reasoning.

- 🐍 **Python Engineering**  
  Strong skills in APIs, automation, data parsing, tool-calling, structured outputs (Pydantic), and async systems.

- 🌐 **AI-Driven Web Interfaces**  
  Create HTML/JavaScript templates powered by AI for real-time interactions and content generation.

- ⚙️ **Tooling + Fast Learning**  
  I can pick up any new SDK or stack in days and deploy results fast.
